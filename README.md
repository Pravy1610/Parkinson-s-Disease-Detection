# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
Parkinson's disease affects movement, causes tremors and stiffness, and is a progressive illness of the central nervous system. It comprises five stages and affects more than 1 million people in India each year. There is currently no treatment for this chronic condition. It is a neurodegenerative condition that affects brain cells that make dopamine.  
In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and machine learning algorithms, we will build a model using an XGBClassifier. We’ll load the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, build a Classifier model, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.
