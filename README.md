# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
Project Outline:   
Parkinson's Disease is a brain neurological disorder. This disease affects movement, causes tremors and stiffness, and is a progressive illness of the central nervous system. It comprises five stages and affects more than 1 million people in India each year. There is currently no treatment for this chronic condition. It causes the body to shake, the hands to shake, and it makes the body stiff. At this advanced level, there is still no viable treatment or cure. Only when treatment is initiated at the earliest stage of the disease is it effective. These could potentially save a life in addition to lowering the cost of the illness. The majority of ways can identify Parkinson's disease after it has advanced, which results in basal ganglia, which regulates the movement of the body with a small quantity of dopamine, losing about 60% of their dopamine. 
In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and machine learning algorithms, we will build and evaluate a Classifier 
model. Weâ€™ll load the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, build a Classifier model, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.
